removed agent string sniffing. Now works with any touch device, not just iOS ones

fixed breakage caused by jquery.ui so that MouseHandled internal flag is reset 
before each touchStart event

fixed multi-touch problem. Now correctly cancels a _touchStart if more than one 
finger is down (this is important becuase JQuery UI makes assumptions about 
certain things happening in the right order)
